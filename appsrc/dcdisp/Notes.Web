To use dcdisp with web server/browser:

1. In the unix browser's mailcap file (perhaps your home .mailcap) add:

	application/x-dicom; echo "Press 'Q' in DICOM display window to quit" \; /usr/local/bin/dcdisp -noattributes %s

  (obviously with the path replaced as required)
  (note that if ; is used, it must be escaped \;)

  or, if full help information is wanted:

	application/x-dicom; /usr/local/bin/dcdisp -noattributes -showwithhelp %s

  or, if you need no guidance:

	application/x-dicom; /usr/local/bin/dcdisp -noattributes %s

  the reload the file by using Options/Preferences/Helpers in Netscape

2. In the servers conf/mime.types (if using CERN httpd) add a mapping
   from some convenient extension to application/x-dicom:

	application/x-dicom            dicom dc3 dcm d10 ctn


If on a Mac, with Netscape, use the preferences/general/helpers
panel to link application/x-dicom to some viewing application - I tried
Dr.Razz from ftp.u.washington.edu/public/razz (versions 0.8a5 and 0.91b6
both worked fine). Choose the "acrN" from the mac file type list.

I also tried Osiris 2.5 but it didn't seem to recognize any other
mac file type than PAPY or PICT, it wouldn't even open the sample
DICOM files on the CD-ROM when they were double clicked. It did
recognized them if they were opened from within Osiris from the File
menu, but this is no use from Netscape. These CD-ROM files had a file
type of DICM for future reference.
