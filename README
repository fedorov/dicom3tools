Compile and install instructions are in INSTALL.

Restrictions on use and redistribution are in COPYRIGHT.

A log of changes over time is in CHANGES.

This is even more ultra-alpha than the previous generation of
dicom3tools 0.nn.

It is being released as a snapshot of work in progress for
people to see the future direction of the toolkit, and assess
its portability.

Some of the tools, such as dcdisp provided significantly
increased functionality over the earlier toolkit. The convertors
from proprietary formats do a much better job of creating DICOM
files than their predecssors, but are not as complete in their
coverage of formats (yet).

Sequences are supported, as are all "modern" DICOM encoding
features, such as UN VR. Compressed transfer syntaxes are
not explicitly supported except by scripts using external
codecs. The data dictionary is kept up to date with the latest
supplements and corrections to the standard.

Part 10 style files with a meta-header are now the default
form of output, though this can be suppressed with an option.

Comments, criticism and general abuse are greatly appreciated and
should be directed to "dclunie@dclunie.com".
