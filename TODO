021122 - add GPWL modules

010424 - dciodvfy issues:

	- need to be able to specify attributes that may be present with conditional unsatisfied
	- need to be able to specialize attributes and weaken conditions (defined terms, presence
	  or absence)
	- need to be able to forbid the presence of modules

970916 - Using zero length for -r "" doesn't work

before adding

to dictionary, caused a problem on writing as EVRLE ->

need to check the VL writing logic for UN with EVRLE or something.

removed the 000xnn support from ancreate ... update this in the man
page.

Check that all awk scripts that use make and match $ work on both
buggy sun nawk and others re. RLENGTH.

	- checked convert,elmdict,sopcl,transyn ... ok

  4. Type `make install prefix=/usr/gnu/' (or the appropriate root
     of your local GNU software installation tree) to copy bash to
     your binaries directory, assumed to be ${prefix}/bin.  This will
     also attempt to install the manual pages under ${prefix}/man
     and the info file under ${prefix}/info.

pacedump and pacetodc are not failing on an empty input file ... loop
forever :(

Clean up the use of C options (esp. defines) in imake stuff

Make dctoraw work for other than -endian little (or at least where
endian matches the ts) and 8 bit data.

Check the use of Binary options vs. WithByteOrder, etc.

Better implementation of attribute list ... sparse arrays with access
and append cache ?

Add to dcdisp
	- annotation: side indicators
	- save window/level'd image ...
		- as DICOM with new attributes
		- as something 8 bit

The srcsink buffering stuff is still pretty horrible,
especially wrt. checking premature eof ... probably should
switch to bool rather than int and consider changing read()
return value to flag rather than length. Note that currently
read() will still be good and will return < chunksize bytes on
last read (ie. byteswanted doesn't have to be multiple of chunksize);
if read() is called again it will return 0 and set bad.
However if less bytes returned than "expected", will set bad and
return 0 immediately (though what was read will still be in the buffer
and the getBufferCount() will be what was actually read).

dccp from 12/16 bits to -r BitsAllocated 8 runs but image is wrong.
This is not suprising, because in writing in attrothr.cc

OtherUnspecifiedLargeAttributeBase::writeData(BinaryOutputStream& stream)
{
...
	if (dstbytesinword == 1) {
		Assert(dstbitsallocated == 8);	// No PackByte() yet !
		ConvertUint16ToByte   tobyte   (*srcpixeldata,dstendian);
		Sink<unsigned char>   output   (stream,tobyte);
		output.write(dstlength);
	}
	else {
		PackUint16            topack   (*srcpixeldata,dstbitsallocated);
		ConvertUint16ToByte   tobyte   (topack,dstendian);
		Sink<unsigned char>   output   (stream,tobyte);
		output.write(dstlength);
	}
...

ther is no shifting before topack, which just uses the low dstbitsallocated
of the Unit16 to pack (topcak.cc line 149).

Contrast this with copied reading:

OtherUnspecifiedLargeAttributeCopied::activateSource(void)
...
		if (srcbytesinword == 1) {
			Assert(srcbitsallocated == 8);	// No UnpackByte() yet !
			Assert(!srcfrompack);
			srcpixeldata=srcfrombyte;
		}
		else {
			if (srcfrompack) delete srcfrompack;
			srcfrompack = new UnpackUint16(*srcfrombyte,srcbitsallocated);
			Assert(srcfrompack);
			if (srcfromshift) delete srcfromshift;
			srcfromshift = new UnshiftUint16(*srcfrompack,srcbitsallocated,srcbitsstored,srchighbit);
			Assert(srcfromshift);
			srcpixeldata=srcfromshift;
		}

where an UnshiftUint16 is done after unpacking.


8 bit input with odd number of columns is wrong. For implicit VR where
they need to be packed into OW's topack.c line 135 fails assertion. This
affects pnmtodc

Add MRDR support do dcdirdmp

For dcdirdmp when an attribute for a dir record is missing, one
still gets an assertion failure on string addValue() :(

This should be cleaner !

Also need to extend dir record types to handle RT that doesn't
have images !
